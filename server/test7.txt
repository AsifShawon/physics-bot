- **Main**: A sound system in a residential area produces noise at a level of 85 dB. Calculate the reduction in sound intensity required to bring the noise level down to a safe limit of 70 dB.
- **Follow-Up-1**: If the sound intensity is reduced by 50%, what is the new decibel level?
- **Follow-Up-2**: A vehicle horn produces a sound level of 100 dB. If a soundproof barrier reduces the sound intensity by 75%, what is the new decibel level experienced by a listener?
- **Follow-Up-3**: The permissible noise level in a residential zone is 55 dB. If a factory produces noise at 75 dB, by what percentage should the noise be reduced to meet the permissible limit?

#### **Type**: Conceptual  
- **Main**: How does noise pollution affect the performance of students and workers?
- **Follow-Up-1**: Why is it essential to control noise levels in educational institutions and offices?
- **Follow-Up-2**: How can background noise impact concentration and productivity in workplaces?
- **Follow-Up-3**: What strategies can be employed to create a quieter and more focused learning or working environment?

#### **Type**: Application-Based  
- **Main**: How do industries and factories contribute to noise pollution, and what measures can be taken to mitigate it?
- **Follow-Up-1**: Explain how soundproofing machinery and industrial equipment can reduce noise pollution in factories.
- **Follow-Up-2**: What are the benefits of setting up factories away from residential areas to control noise pollution?
- **Follow-Up-3**: Describe how noise regulations can be enforced in industries to ensure compliance with noise pollution standards.
